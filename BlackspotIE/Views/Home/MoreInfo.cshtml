            <p>
                A traffic accident is may be a random event with a lot of factors. But if multiple accidents happens at a same spot, it is certainly not random but triggered by multiple unexpected events and factors. Also it is difficult to identify crash locations on regional roads with low traffic volumes as it is often being widespread and a lack of reports.<span style="line-height: 2.0;">&nbsp;Accidents are waiting to happen, that is why you should learn with us.</span>

            <p>Australian government will only declares a site to be a black spot if:</p>
            <p>1) It is an intersection or mid-block or short road section and,</p>
            <p>2) A history of at least 3 casualty crashes over the 5 years.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <span style="line-height: 2.0;">With the increase in safety vehicle protection technologies such as airbags, automated braking systems, adaptive cruise controls, etc. A crash with reported injuries could now results in declaring as property damage by authorities. Hence thereby does not meet the official definition of a casualty crash. There are limitations which how the authorities are responsible for road safety, because half of the responsiblity is on the society's side.</span>
